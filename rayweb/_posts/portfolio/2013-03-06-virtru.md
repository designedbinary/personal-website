title:  "Virtru - Creating a system to work within other systems"
description: From 2013 to today, I have been leading the UX effort at Virtru. Encryption is kind of a scary subject for most folks. Through experiments, metrics, and feedback, we discovered that the best approach was to feel as familiar as possible to every user on any platform.
goal: Make Virtru easy to use across all services we integrate with 
results: A system within a system. A general framework that allows Virtru to feel like a natural extension of the service it is working in, while still retaining its own identiy.

Virtru is an encryption software company, currently specializing in encrypted email communication.

I worked at Virtru for about 4 years. During that time, I was the sole product designer handling designs for about 10 different platforms, 15 engineers, and anything else anyone on the team needed. I would do everything from user research, to UX work, UI/ Visual design, and sometimes front-end development. I worked on mobile applications, web sites, and integrating with existing web mail platforms.

Here is a quick sampling of some of the work I did while I was there.

## ROLE
  * Requirements gathering / Discovery documents (mindmaps, journey maps, user interviews, depends on project)
  * Overall UX
  * Lo-fi mockups (sketches, wireframes)
  * Art Direction
  * Hi-fi mockups (full colored mockups, animation examples, simple prototypes)
  * User testing/validation
  * Process creation, review and refinement
