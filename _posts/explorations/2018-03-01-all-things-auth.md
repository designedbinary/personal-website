description: Protecting access to an account is a two player game. On one hand, service providers need to use the right tools and techniques. On the other hand, end-users need to have a certain level of awareness about those tools, proper security hygiene, and red flags to look out for. This project aims to help both sides to improve security overall. 
goal: Improve security through education, thoughtful UX, and proper technical implementation. 
results: <a href="https://www.allthingsauth.com/">All Things Auth</a>, a blog dedicated to improving online security.

Effective security can be found at the intersection of UX and technical best practices. Rock solid technical implmentation of security features without a well thought out user experience would be ignored by users, or worse, circumvented. On the other side of the spectrum, a delightful authorization experiences would be worthless without the proper implementation. 

The aim of this blog series is to help both service providers and end-users to provide better security features through some thoughtful UX, knowledge and best practices. 

There's still a lot to do and a lot of ground to cover, but we hope to affect positive change for everyone.

There's a lot of great content on the blog. Here's a few of the articles I've worked on so far:
